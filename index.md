# Tutorial

Until a proper video tutorial is made, here some quick steps to start using Savestate2snes.

* Get USB2SNES version 6 or later.
* Download Savestate2snes and extract it
* You can put Savestate2snes folder on `usb2snes/apps` folder
* Power on your console
* Start the usb2snes application
* Start Savestate2snes from the client menu on usb2snes
* Create a new game with the `New game` button
* Right-click on the category view to add a category and click on it (you can do sub categories!)
* Run your game (You can do that when you want)
* When the `patch rom` button became available click on it
* Load/Save/Make Savestate buttons should be available: You are good to go!

## Notes

The `Make savestate` button will trigger a savestate from the game, understand: it will create a savestate with the current state.

The `Save savestate` button will save the last savestate made 
(ether with the controller save savestate shortcut or a previous `Make savestate` action) and save it.
It does not trigger a savestate.

Savestates and categories are just files and folder created on your computer. 
You can move them around if you want to move/copy savestate across categories but It's recommended to close Savestate2snes before doing that.

# Bugs

## Knows issues

If you power on/off your console, there is a chance USB2SNES get lost (very likly on Windows 7) and will refuse for Savestate2snes to reconnect to it. You will have to restart usb2snes and savestate2snes.
