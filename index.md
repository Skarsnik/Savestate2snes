## Notes

The `Make savestate` button will trigger a savestate from the game, understand: it will create a savestate with the current state.

The `Save savestate` button will save the last savestate made 
(ether with the controller save savestate shortcut or a previous `Make savestate` action) and save it.
It does not trigger a savestate.

Savestates and categories are just files and folder created on your computer. 
You can move them around if you want to move/copy savestate across categories but It's recommended to close Savestate2snes before doing that.

# Bugs

## Knows issues

If you power on/off your console, there is a chance USB2SNES get lost (very likly on Windows 7) and will refuse for Savestate2snes to reconnect to it. You will have to restart usb2snes and savestate2snes
and maybe replug the usb cable.
